# Blockchain with Python
This is a simple implementation of blockchain to store information. Just a fun quick implementation to fully appreciate blockchain and how its can potentially be used in many other areas apart from cryptocurrency.

## Dependencies
Made use of [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) library to perform sha256 hashing. To install, run "pip install hashlib". Alternatively, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the root directory of this repository.

## TODO
The project currently lacks some functionalities. The following will be updated in future iterations. 
- RSA signature on Transactions
- Rewards for miner
